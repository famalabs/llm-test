Identify the key information and facts required to correctly answer the query.\n2.  **Compare**: Evaluate the `GIVEN ANSWER` against the `EXPECTED ANSWER` based on the criteria of **Accuracy**, **Completeness**, and **Relevance**.\n3.  **Score**: Assign a **Correctness Score** from 0.0 to 1.0 using the detailed rubric below.\n4.  **Justify**: Write a brief, concise explanation (1-3 sentences) for your score, highlighting the key reasons for your decision.\n\n---\n\n### **Scoring Rubric**\n\n* **1.0 (Perfectly Correct)**: The answer is fully accurate, complete, and relevant. It perfectly matches the expected answer's intent and content.\n* **0.9 (Highly Correct)**: The answer is almost perfect, with only a negligible or stylistic error.\n* **0.8 (Very Correct)**: The answer is factually accurate and complete but might have a minor issue, like slightly awkward phrasing or a trivial omission.\n* **0.7 (Correct)**: The answer is factually accurate but is missing some non-critical details or context.\n* **0.6 (Fairly Correct)**: The answer is mostly correct but has a noticeable omission of a key detail.\n* **0.5 (Moderately Correct)**: The answer is partially correct and addresses about half of the query's requirements but has significant gaps or minor inaccuracies.\n* **0.4 (Somewhat Correct)**: The answer contains some correct information but is fundamentally incomplete or has notable inaccuracies.\n* **0.3 (Slightly Correct)**: The answer has a small element of truth but is mostly wrong or misses the main point of the query.\n* **0.2 (Very Slightly Correct)**: The answer is almost entirely incorrect but contains a single, barely relevant correct detail.\n* **0.1 (Virtually Incorrect)**: The answer is factually incorrect and irrelevant, but tangentially related to the query's topic.\n* **0.0 (Incorrect)**: The answer is completely wrong. **Assign a 0.0 if the answer contains false facts, is entirely unrelated to the query, or provides only generic, non-helpful information (e.g., \"That's a great question\").**\n\n---\n\n### **Required Output Format**\n\nProvide your response using the following json structure:\n\n{\n    \"score\" : <Your 0.0-1.0 score>,\n    \"explanation\": <Your 1-3 sentence explanation.> \n}\n\n---\n\n### **Example**\n\n**QUERY:**\n`What is the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure?`\n\n**EXPECTED ANSWER:**\n`The boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure is 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit).`\n\n**GIVEN ANSWER:**\n`Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius.`\n\n**Your Output:**\n\n{\n    \"score\": 0.8,\n    \"explanation\" : \"The answer is accurate by providing the correct boiling point in Celsius.
