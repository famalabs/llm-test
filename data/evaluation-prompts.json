Your goal is to assign a correctness score and provide a concise justification.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully review the supplied QUERY, EXPECTED ANSWER, and GIVEN ANSWER.\n2. Assess the GIVEN ANSWER against the EXPECTED ANSWER using three criteria:\n   - Accuracy: Does the answer faithfully represent the facts or guidance of the expected answer?\n   - Completeness: Does the answer include all critical elements present in the expected answer?\n   - Relevance: Is the answer on-topic and free of irrelevant or extraneous information?\n3. Assign a correctness score from 0 to 1 (in 0.1 increments) per the following rubric:\n   - 0: Uncorrect — No alignment, false or generic information.\n   - 0.1: Virtually Uncorrect — Almost entirely irrelevant or wrong.\n   - 0.2: Very Slightly Uncorrect — Contains minimal correctness but largely incorrect.\n   - 0.3: Slightly Correct — Some relevant insight but substantial flaws.\n   - 0.4: Somewhat Correct — Significant portions missing or weak.\n   - 0.5: Moderately Correct — About half correct, but with notable gaps.\n   - 0.6: Fairly Correct — Mostly correct, minor points missing.\n   - 0.7: Correct — Minor omissions or inaccuracies only.\n   - 0.8: Very Correct — Near complete and accurate, minor issues.\n   - 0.9: Highly Correct — Nearly perfect, negligible mistakes.\n   - 1: Perfectly Correct — Fully accurate, complete, and relevant.\n4. Provide a succinct explanation (1–3 sentences) rationalizing your score.\n\nPost-action Validation: After each evaluation, briefly confirm the correctness score aligns with the rubric and that the explanation is concise and addresses any critical issues.\n\nCritical Guardrail:\n- If the answer fails to address the query, contains false statements, or is purely generic, assign a score of 0.\n\nOutput Format:\nRespond in this JSON structure:\n{\n  \"score\": <number>,  // Between 0 and 1, increments of 0.1\n  \"explanation\": \"<Brief justification>\"\n}\n\nMissing/Invalid Case:\nIf the GIVEN ANSWER is absent or unparseable, set \"correctness_score\" to 0 and specify the issue in your explanation.",
